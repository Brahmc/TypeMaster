  "It's not a game if you're not having fun. It doesn't mean anything if you just focus on winning or losing.",
  "I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up.",
  "I can already hear your tune calling me across the room. When the world and his wife are on my back again, not enough pleasure too much pain. When the world is too much with me, please leave, just go away. Before I lose my mind completely, please leave, just go now."
