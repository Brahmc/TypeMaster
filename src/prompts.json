  "It's not a game if you're not having fun. It doesn't mean anything if you just focus on winning or losing.",
  "I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things that blow up.",
  "I can already hear your tune calling me across the room. When the world and his wife are on my back again, not enough pleasure too much pain. When the world is too much with me, please leave, just go away. Before I lose my mind completely, please leave, just go now.",
  "Although the United Nations does not have the power to enforce decisions or compel nations to take military action, the ability to compel member nations to impose economic sanctions against countries guilty of violating security orders gives it significant power in the world stage.",
  "There are very few things I wish I could change about those two decades, but there are many things I wish I had known. I wish I had known, for instance, that such a long period of being single was in the cards for me. I also wish I'd known earlier that such a delay was not abnormal among my generation.",
  "Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.",
  "At first they had tried to keep the finding quiet. After all, they were not absolutely sure it was an extraterrestrial message. A premature or mistaken announcement would be a public relations disaster.",
  "I told you, I'm busy. So anyone who gets in my way gets punched.",
  "I'd like to build the world a home and furnish it with love. Grow apple trees and honey bees and snow white turtle doves. I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company.",
  "Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find. I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind. Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood. It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.",
  "A good person? Well... I don't really like that term. Because to me, it just seems to mean someone who's good for you. And I don't think there's any one person who's good for everyone.",
  "All men burn with foolish jealousy, but women are fools to take delight in it. This world is full of fools no matter where you look.",
  "When someone's lying, what's important is not the content of the lie, but the reasoning behind it.",
  "If you're looking at a single withered tree, it can seem like a grievous wound to the forest. But from the forest's perspective, that tree's remains will nourish other plants, acting for the good of the whole forest. If you change your perspective, a situation right in front of you can reverse itself",
  "People can run from the things they don't like all they want. But if they're just averting their eyes, they're not running. As long as you think the current situation is okay, no one can help",
  "But still... Not trying to undo misunderstandings is the same as telling a lie.",
  "You're not happy because you're not trying to be happy. Nobody can make someone who isn't trying to be happy into someone that's happy.",
  "Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones",
  "Prefer knowledge to wealth, for the one is transitory, the other perpetual.",
  "He who is not contented with what he has, would not be contented with what he would like to have.",
  "By all means marry; if you get a good wife, you'll become happy; if you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher.",
  "Staying misfortunate is negligence, and not trying to become happy is cowardice."
